	As you are using amino acid data, we selected the DE-Score - the Dayhoff Exchange Score. This is based on the ratio of pairwise within Dayhoff Category changes and between Dayhoff Category changes throughout the alignment. It also has the advantage that it can be used to detect taxa that are particularly saturated. We call this the tDE-Score.
	The DE-Score of this entire dataset is $totalDE, with a Dayhoff Category Exchange Ratio of $TIFreq.
	The DE-Score is the average of the taxon-specific DE-Scores.
        When evaluating the total DE-Score, consider two things. First, a DE-Score below 0 indicates that the data is completely saturated, and likely uninformative - for best results, seek a DE-Score of 0.354 or higher. This means that the alignment is 2 minimum-information steps away from total saturation (2x0.177 away from DE-Score 0). When comparing between alignments, the one with a higher DE-Score has less entropic site saturation.";
